## Liri

Liri is supposed to interact with what you tell her to do. We are working on the bugs, but if you were to type in "spotify-this-song *enter song*" for example in the terminal, she will bring back all the information about this song artist etc. She will also do the same with commands "movie-this", "concert-this". With Movie-this it takes the omdb api and runs it, generating all the information of the movie you decide to type in. Exactly with the concert-this, it will generate the concert you type in and show you all the information including venues etc.
